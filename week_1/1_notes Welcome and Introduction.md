# Welcome and Introduction Notes

Examples of Machine learning:

- google searching curating / wrangling pages
- recognizing friends in pictures
- spam filter in email
- neural networks

Exercises are intended to help us practice.

ML was developed as a new capability for computers for certain novel problems.

## Video: Welcome

- database mining
- applications that cannot be programmed by hand (e.g. autonomous helicopters, handwriting recognition, NLP, computer vision)
- self-customizing programs (e.g., recommendation systems)
- assistance with understanding of human learning

## Video: What is Machine Learning?

no well-accepted definition

- Arthur Samuel (1959): ability to learn without being explicitly programmed - computer that played 10,000s of checkers games against itself
- Tom Mitchell (1998): learning from experience in respect to a task as measured by a metric
  > A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Q: spam case, what is task T?
A: classifying emails

### Content overview / Types of machine learning algorithms

- **Supervised learning**: given a data set, try to predict for novel values where they fall, either within a discrete output (regression problem) or among a set of discrete categories (categorization problem).
- **Unsupervised learning**: given an unlabeled data set, categorize the data set.
- **Reinforcement learning**: \_\_
- Also will talk about practical advice for applying learning algorithms well. Carpenter analogy: what's important is knowing how to use the tools property.

## Video: Supervised Learning

"right answers" given, AI challenged to find more right answers.

Examples:

- Regression problem: predict value, selecting appropriate regression algorithm.
- Classificaiton problem: predict which category a novel observation falls into based on pre-classified training data

## Video: Unupervised Learning

Given an unlabeled data set, ML algorithm decides what to do with it. E.g., a clustering algorithm that breaks data into clusters. E.g., finding structure in a chaotic environment (e.g. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a cocktail party).

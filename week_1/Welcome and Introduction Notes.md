# Welcome and Introduction Notes

Examples of Machine learning:
  * google searching curating / wrangling pages
  * recognizing friends in pictures
  * spam filter in email

  neural networks


Exercises are intended to help us practice.

ML was developed as a new capability for computers for certain novel problems.

### Video: Welcome
- database mining
- applications that cannot be programmed by hand (e.g. autonomous helicopters, handwriting recognition, NLP, computer vision)
- self-customizing programs (e.g., recommendation systems)
- assistance with understanding of human learning

### Video: What is Machine Learning?
no well-accepted definition

* Arthur Samuel (1959): ability to learn without being explicitly programmed - computer that played 10,000s of checkers games against itself
* Tom Mitchell (1998): learning from experience in respect to a task as measured by a metric

Q: spam case, what is task T?
A: classifying emails

##### Content overview / Types of machine learning algorithms
* Supervised learning: __
* Unsupervised learning: machine learns on its own
* Reinforcement learning: __
* Also will talk about practical advice for applying learning algorithms well. Carpenter analogy: what's important is knowing how to use the tools property.
